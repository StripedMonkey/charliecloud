==What does this do?==
This test sets up an Rstudio-server instance then checks that we can 
login into it and runs some example code using an associated R instance.

==Why?==
 Running interactive applications in contianers is becoming increasingly 
popular due to Jupyter and other systems. This test provides a framework for
 testing such systems. 

==How==
It uses the selenium python library which automates
 browser testing for webdevelopement. We install Firefox in the container
for selenium to attach to. 

==Weird Catches==
The r-studio server is a daemon that we launch as a background process. 
The daemon was getting stuck in the test running it as a normal background 
process with &. We were able to workaround this by launching it with 
subprocess.popen in python.
