RStudio is an IDE for the R programming language, and its RStudio Server
flavor is used in a web browser, somewhat like Jupyter Notebook. This example
runs an RStudio Server instance and then tests that it can be accessed by a
headless Firefox automated using geckodriver and Selenium.

At present, we haven't yet figured out how to do an R computation in RStudio
using Selenium (issue #XXXX), so we just test logging into RStudio, with a
separate test that R works.
